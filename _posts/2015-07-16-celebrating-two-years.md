It is Sparkplug's 2nd birthday and we are ready to celebrate! With this year, and others to come, we intend to celebrate with our community by making amazing offers for our local community of digital natives and wanderers. This year, we have chosen to give back to our large community of writers, bloggers and small businesses.

There is plenty of interesting, and quite honestly, hilarious bloggers, photographers and Twitterati with a lot to do, say and share with us. However, we have noticed that the one lacking thing is a solid online presence and portfolio. 
Lots of original local content littered all over Blogger, Google Plus, Wordpress.com among others. Too much clutter, poor SEO, and not the best looking websites. We seek to change this.  

Alongside the bloggers and photographers, we also wish to give back to the micro, small and medium enterprises and non-profit organizations that form a large part of our community. We wish to support your efforts by building beautiful, clean websites that reflect the essence of your works and programs while allowing organizational culture and ethos to shine through.

Introducing the blogger, photographer and SME bundles.
