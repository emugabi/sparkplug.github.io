It is Sparkplug's 2nd birthday and we are ready to celebrate! We intend to do this with our local community of digital natives and wanderers. The wonderful  group of writers, bloggers, photographers and small businesses. You furnish us with useful and anecdotal information. Now it's time for us to help you be your best.

Many bloggers, photographers and Twitterati have a lot to say and share with us. We have noticed, however, that many lack a solid online presence and portfolio. 

Lots of original local content littered all over Blogger, Google Plus, Wordpress.com among others. Too much clutter, poor SEO, and not the best looking websites. We seek to change this.  

We also wish to give back to the micro, small and medium enterprises and non-profit organizations. We hope to do this by building beautiful, clean websites that reflect the essence of your work and programs while allowing organizational character, culture and ethos to shine through.

Introducing the blogger, photographer and SME bundles:
